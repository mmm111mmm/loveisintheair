                    Not just make it invisible - but remove this.
                    But what, what I ask you - what are the implications? We run around,
                    we do this, we do that. But do we think of the implications of our actions?
                    The world is complex. One action may lead to another.
                    There is cause and effect. One word, one snap, and the effect in another.
                    And so behaviour, moods, move from one to another. And they feed back.
                    From one person to another. From one community to another. To one nation to another.
                    There is a word for this. Some call it karma. Some call it not being a dick.
                    You could remove the below. Remove it. 
                    Nothing will happen. It's fine. It's fine.
